The dataset used for the project was also interesting in its information as it involves Customer demographics and shopping behavior i.e. Predict Customer Purchase Behavior Dataset.
The accuracy of Decision Tree classifier, it is 89.67%, the precision is 91.45%, recall is 83.59% and the F1 score is 87.35%. This shows that the model is able to classify the purchasing customer properly but classification does have some false positives. Despite being a simpler and interpretable model, Logistic Regression also scored an accuracy of 83.67% (approx.) with a precision of 87.62%, a recall of 71.88% and an F1 score of 78.97% respectively (Lee et al. 2021). Although less accurate than other models, it provides a good baseline for prediction. In comparison to the other models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved an accuracy of 87.00% with 88.70% Precision, 79.69% Recall, and F1 83.95%, providing balanced performance across all evaluation metrics. Random Forest classifier has the maximum performance among models with accuracy: 95.33%, precision: 99.14%, recall: 89.84% and F1 score: 94.26%.
